# ðŸ”§ Build Fix - GitHub Actions Update

## Issue Fixed
The build was failing due to deprecated GitHub Actions versions:
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` â†’ Updated to `v4`
- `actions/checkout@v3` â†’ Updated to `v4`
- `actions/setup-java@v3` â†’ Updated to `v4`

## Changes Made

### Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
- âœ… Updated all actions to latest versions
- âœ… Added Gradle caching for faster builds
- âœ… Added build summary with download instructions
- âœ… Set artifact retention to 30 days

### New Features
- **Faster Builds**: Gradle cache reduces build time
- **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages

2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click "Build Android APK" workflow

## Expected Result
